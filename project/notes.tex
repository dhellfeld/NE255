\textbf{Notes for writing papers properly:}
\begin{itemize}
\item If you include figures, use a Figure number and caption; refer to the figure from within the text as Fig.\ \# or Figure \#.
\item You may need to number equations and refer to them in the text.
\item \textit{Use section headings for the requested sections.}
\item In the introduction, discuss what is coming up in the paper. 
\item In the conclusions, discuss what you told us in the paper.
\item If you talk about a code (that you didn't write yourself), you need to include a reference for that code. 
\item For the final report, it's a good idea to include enough information for the work to be reproducible. To avoid making the report filled with mundane details you can put some items in an appendix or repository that you reference.
\item Common grammar errors: \href{http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/which-versus-that-0}{that vs.\ which}, \href{http://grammarpartyblog.com/2012/01/17/use-versus-utilize/}{use vs.\ utilize}, \href{https://e-gmat.com/blog/gmat-verbal/sentence-correction/idioms/due-to-vs-because-of}{due to vs.\ because of}.
